# Pulp_Movie_Names

## This is a project from the **Codecademy**  course ***Full-Stack Engineer***.

### Project Objectives:
* Build a message generator program using JavaScript
* Use Git version control
* Use Command Line
* Delvelop locally on your computer

### My Solution:

>> My project has an object containing 3 arrays, each array with a list of words (adjective, creature and origins).

>> A function which takes an array as an argument and returns a randomly selected element.

>> A template string for a Pulp Horror Movie title, which is then populated with random words using the aforementioned function.

>> Finally, random movie names are output to the console.

### Suggestion for future development:
> ***""In addition to doing random messages, you could add random ASCII art."***
